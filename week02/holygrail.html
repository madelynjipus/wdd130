                    <p>"The Holy Grail is a treasure that serves as an important motif in Arthurian literature. Various traditions describe the Holy Grail as a cup, dish, or stone with miraculous healing powers, sometimes providing eternal youth or sustenance in infinite abundance, often guarded in the custody of the Fisher King and located in the hidden Grail castle." - wikipedia</p>

                    <p>"The Holy Grail, said to be the cup from which Jesus Christ drank at the Last Supper, has been sought after by knights and scholars for almost 1000 years. This chalice, imbued with the mystery of the divine, is said to have also caught the blood of Christ at the Crucifixion." - historyskills/p>
